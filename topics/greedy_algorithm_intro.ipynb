Again, the knapsack has a fixed capacity, and the items are associated with weights, $w_1, w_2, ..., w_m$, and values $v_1, v_2, ..., v_m$. While our goal is still to pack the knapsack with a combination of items so that it carries the highest possible value, the 0-1 knapsack variation comes with the constraint that we can only carry 1 copy of each item.
